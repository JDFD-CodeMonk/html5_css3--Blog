          The first big rule in sale is that if the person leave empty-handed,
          they're likely not going to come back. That's why you have to be 
          somewhat aggressive when you're working with a customer, but you have
          to make sure you don't overdo it and scare them away.

          One way you can keep a conversation going is to avoid asking questions
          that have yes or no answers. For example, you're selling a service
          plan, don't ever ask &ldquo;Are you interested in our 3 or 5 year
          service plan?&rdquo; Instead, ask &ldquo;Are you interesred in the 3 
          year service plan or 5 year plan, which is a better value?&rdquo;
          At first glance, they appeat to be asking the same thing, and while
          a customer can still opt out, it's harder for them to opt out of
          the second question because they have to say more than just
          &ldquo;no.&rdquo;
